🗂️ Types of Wireframes
Wireframes are categorized based on their level of detail and visual fidelity. The two most common types are:

🔹 Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Low-fidelity wireframes are basic, simplified sketches that focus on structure and layout rather than design or content precision.

Purpose: Quick exploration of ideas, layout planning, and early stakeholder feedback.

Appearance: Often black and white, with boxes and placeholders (e.g., “Image Here” or “Button”).

Tools Used: Pen and paper, Balsamiq, or simple digital sketch tools.

When to Use: Early stages of design to brainstorm layout and content hierarchy.

🔹 High-Fidelity Wireframes
High-fidelity wireframes are detailed and closely resemble the final product. They include specific UI components, actual text, branding elements, and sometimes interactivity.

Purpose: To refine and finalize visual design, gather more specific feedback, and hand off to developers.

Appearance: Polished visuals, sometimes with color, icons, and real content.

Tools Used: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch.

When to Use: Later stages of design when confirming UI decisions and preparing for development.
